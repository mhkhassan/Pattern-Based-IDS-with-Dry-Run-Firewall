# Pattern-Based-IDS-with-Dry-Run-Firewall
A simple, educational Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built with Python and Scapy. It inspects TCP packet payloads, matches configurable patterns (e.g., domain names), logs activity, and can optionally trigger a “firewall” response (dry-run by default).

This project is intended for learning and demos, not for production security.
